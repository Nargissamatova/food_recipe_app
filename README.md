# Food Recipe App

This Food Recipe App is a React-based application that allows users to search for and explore a wide variety of recipes.

Users can search for recipes by keyword, filter results by cuisine or dietary preferences.

## Features

- **Search Recipes**: Quickly find recipes by entering keywords.
- **Filter Results**: Narrow down recipes based on cuisine, diet, and other preferences.
- **Recipe Details**: View comprehensive details about each recipe, including ingredients and steps.
